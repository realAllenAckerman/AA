我没有特定的[[投资]]风格， 也没有固定的策略和原则，如果说我的一贯作风，那 就是持续寻找市场中游戏规则的变化。      

但至少分析的框架可以让我明了面临的形势。在顺境中表现出众，在逆境中又能够控制亏损，难道这还不是一个成功的方法吗？

Survive first and make money afterwards.

It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.

Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes.

The financial markets generally are unpredictable. So that one has to have different scenarios... The idea that you can actually predict what's going to happen contradicts my way of looking at the market.

We try to catch new trends early and in later stages we try to catch trend reversals. Therefore, we tend to stabilize rather than destabilize the market. We are not doing this as a public service. It is our style of making money.
